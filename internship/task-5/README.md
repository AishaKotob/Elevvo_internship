# Task 5 — Responsive SaaS Landing (FlowPilot)
**Owner:** Aisha Kotob

A modern, responsive landing page for a fictional SaaS product built with **HTML, CSS (Tailwind)**, and **JavaScript** + **Three.js** (custom 3D icosahedron). Includes Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, and a CTA, with a **theme toggle (light/dark)** and smooth micro-interactions.

## ✅ What I built (matching the task brief)
- **Sections:** Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, Call-to-Action.
- **Responsive layout:** Mobile, tablet, and desktop (Grid/Flex via Tailwind).
- **Theme toggle:** Pure JavaScript with `localStorage` + `prefers-color-scheme`.
- **Interactive 3D:** Three.js **icosahedron** (no parallax), right-aligned in hero.
- **Pricing polish:** Centered prices, badges, and hover/scale effects on all cards.
- **Micro-interactions:** Card hover, nav hover glow, reveal-on-scroll.
- **Clean grid & icons** using Tailwind utilities.

## Tech & Libraries
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Tailwind CSS** (CDN utilities, custom brand/mint colors)
- **Three.js** for WebGL 3D (icosahedron mesh + wireframe)
- Layout with **Flexbox/Grid**  
- (Bootstrap optional — not needed here due to Tailwind)
